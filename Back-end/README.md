This is a basic MEAN stack development project.

INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE STARTING THE BACKEND SERVER.

Before running the backend server please replace/add the correct environmant variables into ".env" file. (Please refer to my mail.)

To start the backend server navigate into "Back-end" folder and run "npm run start". The server should start running on port 9000.
If the DB credentials are correctly added into the ".env" file then the server should connect to MONGODB cloud DB.

Also dont forget to add "JWT_SECRET" in the ".env" file.
